The courses consist of laboratory work in small groups, with preliminary studies and reports. In addition to these courses, several other courses included laboratory work.","p14":"The courses in programming are: Bayesian Inference and Machine Learning; Data Structures and Algorithms and Programming techniques and numerical analysis.","p15":"In addition to the above courses, I am taking a freestanding elective MTS course, Mathematics and Society, which I will probably be able to credit in my upcoming master’s degree. The course includes mentoring and lectures in mathematics for high school students during the current course.","p2":"My merit score from upper secondary school is 21.00 out of 22.50. During upper secondary school I studied, among other things, programming 1 and programming 2 in Java, which means that I have good knowledge of programming in Java."},"ach":{"h1":"5-place in ","p1":"Högstadiets nationella matemariktävlig"}},"sv": {"edu":{"h1":"Teknisk Fysik, Chalmers Tekniska Högskola","h2":"Naturvetenskapsprogrammet, Sundlergymnasiet","p10":"något här","p11":"text","p12":"text","p13":"text","p14":"text","p15":"text","p2":"text här"},"ach":{"h1":"text","p1":"text"}}}
